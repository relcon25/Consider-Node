General Language Notes
=======================

.. index:: Comments

Comments
--------

Both tag space and decision graph files support line and block comments.

A line comment starts with ``<--`` and extends until the end of the line, like so::

  Fruit: one of apple, banana, orange. <-- A comment about the fruits.

A block comment is contained between ``<*`` and ``*>``, like so::

  <* the following node matches
   * a fruit to the user, based on
   * the user's abilities.
   *>
  [ask:
    {text: Can you peel?}
    {answers:
      {yes: [set: Fruit=banana]}
      {no:  [set: Fruit=apple]}
      <* User survey note:
         Some people peel apples too, we may need
         to revisit this culinary choice. *>
    }
  ]


Files
-----

Files are assumed to be encoded in Unicode. By convention, files describing tags spaces have a ``.ts`` suffix, while files describing decision graphs have a ``.dg`` one.

Top-Down Support
----------------

As developing a full questionnaire may benefit from a top-down approach, it is possible to add placeholders for unimplemented parts. This allows questionnaire developers to reference those parts now, and implement them later. Creating placeholders is done using the ``TODO`` keyword (in tag spaces) and the ``[todo]`` node in decision graphs.

In the below example of a tag space definition, ``Policy`` already contains ``Sharing``, although is it not implemented yet ::

  Policy: consists of Security, Sharing.
  Sharing: TODO.
  Security: consists of ...

In the below decision graph snippet, the ``EU-Compliance`` section is referenced from other nodes. At runtime, the engine will pass through it (so that it appears in the run logs). Yet, it's just a placeholder, to be replaced later with a full questionnaire::

  [ask:
    {text: Was some of the data collected in the EU?}
    {answers:
      {yes: [call: EU-Compliance]}}]
  <* More code here *>

  [>EU-Compliance< todo: This section will ensure compliance with the EU regulations.]



Language Name
-------------
Used to be "datatags", but as there are now more efforts for creating DataTags implementation, we don't want to hog the name.
We're currently leaning towards *Tags*, but other suggestions are welcome!
